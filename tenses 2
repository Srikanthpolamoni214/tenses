Situation 1 – My First Stage Performance

It was three years ago when I gave my first stage performance.
I had always dreamed (past perfect) of performing in front of a large audience, but I had never expected it to happen so soon.
On the day of the event, I was feeling (past continuous) both excited and nervous.
When my name was called (past simple), I walked onto the stage, and the lights were so bright that I could barely see the audience.
I started singing, and halfway through, I realized the audience was clapping (past continuous) along with the music.
By the time I finished, I had overcome (past perfect) my fear of performing in public.


Situation 2 – The Day I Lost My Wallet

Last summer, I was traveling (past continuous) to another city for a friend’s wedding.
I had packed (past perfect) all my essentials, including my wallet with important cards and some cash.
When I got off the train, I noticed my pocket felt light.
I quickly checked and found that my wallet was missing (past simple).
I had been walking (past continuous) around the platform searching for it when a kind stranger approached me.
He handed me my wallet and told me he had found (past perfect) it under one of the seats.
That moment restored my faith in kindness, and I will never forget it.
